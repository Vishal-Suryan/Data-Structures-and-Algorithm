**Title:** Data Structures & Algorithms Practice (Java)

**Description:**

This repository serves as a personal record of my progress through the Strivers DSA A2Z course, a highly regarded program for learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java. It contains code implementations for various topics covered in the course, ranging from fundamental concepts to advanced algorithms.

**Purpose:**

* To gain a strong foundation in DSA by following the structured learning path of the Strivers DSA A2Z course.
* To solidify my understanding through practical coding exercises.
* To experiment with different approaches and algorithms for problem-solving.
* To track my progress and identify areas for improvement.
